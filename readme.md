## Inspiration
Whenever we go to make snacks there's always one question " What should I make?".This question has haunted us for years and we still can't decide what to make. So we got an idea to solve this problem and save a lot of time that we waste in the kitchen thinking about what to make.  
## What it does
This project has three main features/pages:
1. Find a Random Recipe- On this Webpage, you can randomly generate a recipe. This will help you discover something unknown but delicious snack hidden from you for years. Give it a try to know. Sometimes random results can be deliciousü§§
2. Find a Recipe by Ingredients- On this Webpage, you can find recipes by entering ingredients you have at home. It makes it easy to decide to make a delicious dish you using the ingredients you already have. Sometimes this page can give you recipes for exotic dishes you have never heard of...üòÄ
3. Chat with Healbee- When it comes to snacks, they need to be healthy. So Meet Healbee, she's a bit obsessed with healthy and nutritious food. She is made to promote healthy and nutritious food among the people. Sometimes she can be obsessed with wanting to make you eat healthy food üòÅ

## How we built it
We built the main website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We made the HealBee Chatbot, Find a Random Recipe, and then find a Recipe by Ingredients using Flask, Cohere's NLP API, and Spoonacular's API.
## Challenges we ran into
It was tough to get values from JSON and display it on the website it flask but we finally achieved it the way we wanted.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
That we made something useful and it works the way we envisioned it to be
## What we learned
We learned a lot about using Flask, Cohere's NLP API, and Spoonacular's API.
